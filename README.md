## Overview

Imagine a survey that doesn’t feel like a chore. Instead of spending time typing out every thought, users can simply listen to inspiring questions that play automatically and choose to respond using their voice or by typing. Built with modern web technologies and hosted on cost-effective services, this tool is designed for the modern era of AI, where engagement, ease-of-use, and creative expression matter.

Key objectives of this project:
- **Flexible Input:** Users choose between voice recording or text input to share their aspirations.
- **Instant Audio Interaction:** Questions are delivered via pre-recorded audio that plays automatically (with a replay option).
- **Cost-Minimized:** Leverages free browser APIs and free-tier cloud services.
- **Engaging Visuals:** Real-time, interactive visualizations boost user engagement as they participate.
---
## Features
- **Audio-First Questions:** Uses HTML5 `<audio>` and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities to instantly play survey questions.
- **Dual Response Options:** Leverages the MediaRecorder API for audio responses alongside a conventional text input.
- **Interactive Visual Dashboard:** Dynamic visualizations (built with Chart.js/D3.js) show live survey stats and data.
- **Minimalistic and Responsive Design:** Crafted with modern UI libraries (TailwindCSS or Bootstrap) for a clean, intuitive experience.
- **Cost-Effective Architecture:** Built on free-tier services like Firebase, Heroku, and free browser APIs, ensuring minimal infrastructure costs.

## Tech Stack

### Front-End

- **Framework:** React.js or Vue.js for building a dynamic user interface.
- **HTML5 & Browser APIs:**
    - **`<audio>` Element:** For seamless audio playback.
    - **MediaRecorder API:** Captures voice input directly in the browser.
- **Data Visualization:**
    - **Chart.js/D3.js:** Renders interactive and real-time dashboards.
- **Styling:**
    - **Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap & Custom CSS/SCSS:** For minimalistic and responsive design.
### Back-End
- **Server Environment:**
    - **Node.js with Express.js:** Handles API endpoints, form submissions, and file uploads.
- **Database & Storage:**
    - **Firebase Firestore (or MongoDB Atlas):** Stores survey responses.
    - **Firebase Storage (or AWS S3):** Stores audio files.
- **API Communication:**
    - **Axios/Fetch API:** Connects front-end components with back-end endpoints.

### Deployment & DevOps
- **Hosting:**
    - **Vercel/Netlify for Front-End:** Fast static hosting and continuous deployment.
    - **Heroku (or similar) for Back-End:** Easy-to-manage Node.js deployments.
- **CI/CD:**
    - **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployments.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:**
    - **Sentry/LogRocket and Google Analytics:** Monitor application performance and track user engagement.

## Workflow & Integration

1. **User Experience Flow:**
    - **Landing Page:** Introduces the survey and explains the dual input options.
    - **Question Screen:** Automatically plays a pre-recorded audio question using the `<audio>` tag. The user can replay the audio.
    - **Response Section:** Provides a toggle between recording an audio response (MediaRecorder API) or typing text.
    - **Submission & Visualization:** Upon submission, responses are sent via API calls (Axios/Fetch) to the Node.js back-end. Aggregated data is then visualized in real time.
2. **Data Processing:**
    - **Back-End API:** Receives audio blobs and text responses, uploads audio to cloud storage, and saves response metadata in Firestore/MongoDB.
    - **Visualization Updates:** Front-end polling or real-time updates fetch aggregated data for engaging dashboards.
3. **Continuous Integration & Deployment:**
    - **GitHub Repository:** Source code is version-controlled and integrated with GitHub Actions to run tests automatically.
    - **Deployment Pipeline:** Automates build and deployment processes for both front-end and back-end using Vercel/Heroku.
